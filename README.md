## Overview
This dataset and analysis focus on identifying the reasons behind ride cancellations and trends associated with customer and driver behavior. The data was cleaned and processed from multiple sources, followed by the application of SQL queries to derive insights. The visualizations were created using Power BI to better understand the key factors influencing cancellations.  

This project was completed with the help of youtube channel Topversity.  

## Project Process
Data Cleaning and Processing:
The data was extracted and cleaned to handle missing values and outliers. Various preprocessing steps were applied to ensure the dataset was ready for analysis.

## SQL Queries
A series of SQL queries were applied to perform operations such as:

-> Aggregating data based on different attributes (e.g., ride cancellations, driver ratings).

-> Analyzing trends over time (e.g., peak hours, most common cancellation reasons).

-> Identifying key patterns in customer and driver behaviors.

## Power BI Visualization
Power BI was used to visualize the findings, such as:

-> Ride cancellation trends across various time periods.

-> Customer and driver ratings correlation with cancellation rates.

-> Booking patterns and payment method insights.

## Key Insights:
The analysis identified significant patterns in cancellations, including:

-> Higher cancellation rates during specific hours of the day.

-> Increased cancellations due to specific vehicle types or payment methods.

-> Correlations between driver ratings and cancellation likelihood.

## Reason for Cancellations
The primary reasons for cancellations were attributed to:

-> Issues with pickup locations.

-> Customer changes in booking preferences.

-> Driver unavailability.

# Results
By analyzing the cancellation patterns and implementing a new strategy to address identified issues, the cancellation rate was reduced by 10%.

# Files Included
